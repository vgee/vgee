# VGEE Project Requirements

## Project Overview

VGEE (Very Good Example Environment) is a sample project designed to demonstrate various coding practices and testing strategies. The project implements a simple bot framework using the aiogram library for Telegram bot functionality.

## Functional Requirements

### Bot Functionality

1. The bot should be initialized with a token and optional default settings.
2. If no token is provided, the bot should prompt the user to enter one.
3. The bot should maintain a session for making HTTP requests.
4. The bot should provide methods for closing the session.
5. The bot should support custom attributes through keyword arguments.

### Configuration

1. The project should use environment variables for configuration.
2. Default values should be provided for configuration settings when environment variables are not set.
3. The configuration should include at least TOKEN and DEFAULT_SETTING.

## Technical Requirements

### Code Quality

1. The code should follow PEP 8 style guidelines.
2. The code should be well-documented with comments.
3. The code should be properly typed using Python's typing module.

### Testing

1. The project should have comprehensive unit tests.
2. Tests should verify the functionality of all public methods and properties.
3. Tests should be runnable using the unittest framework.

### Contribution Process

1. Contributors should follow the guidelines in CONTRIBUTING.md.
2. Code changes should be made in separate branches.
3. Pull requests should be submitted for code reviews.
4. All tests should pass before merging changes.

## Constraints

### Dependencies

1. The project should minimize external dependencies.
2. Current dependencies include aiogram and requests.

### Compatibility

1. The project should be compatible with the latest version of Python.
2. The project should work across different operating systems.

## Future Enhancements

1. Improve error handling and logging.
2. Add more comprehensive documentation.
3. Implement additional bot features.
4. Enhance test coverage.
